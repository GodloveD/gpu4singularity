# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish 
to make via issue. 

For your convenience, a script called pre-commit is provided.  Please edit the
script by incrementing the version number (micro for bug fixes, minor for new
functionality, major for re-writes), and then run it to write all relevant 
information into the gpu4singularity script.  

If you're bored, try writing a hook that will determine the new git hash string
when changes are pushed and write them into gpu4singularity using the pre-commit
script. :-)
